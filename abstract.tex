    Since its discovery in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), efforts have been made 
to measure and characterize the properies of the Higgs boson. Among these efforts have
been searches for rare decays of the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model (SM) of particle
physics. One such decay is the process $\sf H\rightarrow Z\gamma$, which is predicted
by the SM to have a branching fraction of XX. An observation 
of this decay mode at a rate deviating from the SM prediction would provide indirect 
evidence of new physics beyond the SM. Previous searches for $\sf H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ 
were carried out using proton-proton collision data from Run 1 of the LHC. Run 1 exclusion
limits on the process were placed at roughly ten times the SM expectation by 
the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. 

    This thesis describes the search for $\sf H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ in the $\sf \ell\ell\gamma$ 
final state with the CMS detector using LHC Run 2 proton-proton collision data. 
The process is not observed, and exclusion limits are placed on the production cross section 
times branching fraction at XX times the SM expectation.
