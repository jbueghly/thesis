% If there is an introduction it must be the first chapter

%\chapter{Introduction or Title of First Chapter}	% The first chapter.
%				% \chapter command is of the form
%				% \chapter[..]{..} or \chapter{..} where
%	... text ...		% {chapter heading} and [entry in table of
%				% contents].
%\section{First section of chapter 1}
%				% IMPORTANT: If your chapter heading consists
%				% of more than one lines, it will be auto-
%	... text ...		% matically broken into separate lines.
%				% However, if you don't like the way LaTeX
%				% breaks the chapter heading into lines, use
%\section{Another section}	% `\newheadline' command to break lines.
%				% Never use \\ in sectional (e.g., chapter,
%	... text ...		% section, subsection) headings.
%
%\chapter{Title of Second Chapter}	% Chapter 2.
%
%	... text ...

% Alternatively, you may write the chapters in separate
% files, say chap1.tex, chap2.tex, etc., and include them 
% with commands:

%\include{chap1}

%\include{chap2}

% The command \includeonly above allows to include a selected 
% set of chapters only.

% Uncomment the 'singlespace' environment and '\bibsep' command

\bibitem{label1} A bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.  A
bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.

\bibitem{label3} Yet another bibliographic item.  
% The usages of \bibitem and \cite{..} are 
% explained in Section 4.3 (page 73) of % LaTeX manual.
% Or you may use BibTeX.

\end{singlespace}

% (The following suggested by Francisco Iacobelli - 5/11/2010)
% In case, you want to use BibTeX, you should replace (or comment)
% the bibliography environment.
% Instead uncomment the following lines and replace <bib file>
% with your .bib file:
% \begin{singlespace}
% \bibsep 12pt
% \bibliographystyle{acm} %or another suitable style.
