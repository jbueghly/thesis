\acknowledgements	% Acknowledgements (optional).

I would like to thank my adviser, Mayda Velasco, for the opportunity to pursue a goal I dreamed up years ago and for her support along the way. I'd also like to thank my many colleagues at Northwestern University, National Central University in Taiwan, CERN, and Fermilab who helped me grow both as a scientist and a person over the course of my Ph.D. 

Special thanks are due to those who significantly impacted the work contained in this thesis: My coanalyzer Ming-Yan Lee, whose discipline and tireless work ethic kept us all going through the many challenges we faced; postdoc Andrew Gilbert, whose expertise and guidance were critical; and the CMS leaders who guided and reviewed our work, including the Higgs conveners, Analysis Review Committee, and our colleague and language editor Jeff Richman. Without all of you, this thesis would not exist.

To my Northwestern colleagues: I will always be grateful for your friendship over these years. The moments we shared away from the work kept me sane, focused, and balanced. It is impossible to name all of them here, but the squash games with Nate Odell, the lunches with Nate, Brian Pollack, Thoth Gunter, and Joseph Cordero Mercado, and our adventures at COFI in San Juan were all very meaningful to me. 

Last, but not least, I want to thank my parents, sisters, and my partner Anna. You all have shown me so much love, encouragement, and patience throughout this process. For that, I feel extremely fortunate. This is for all of you.

% If there is an introduction it must be the first chapter

%\chapter{Introduction or Title of First Chapter}	% The first chapter.
%				% \chapter command is of the form
%				% \chapter[..]{..} or \chapter{..} where
%	... text ...		% {chapter heading} and [entry in table of
%				% contents].
%\section{First section of chapter 1}
%				% IMPORTANT: If your chapter heading consists
%				% of more than one lines, it will be auto-
%	... text ...		% matically broken into separate lines.
%				% However, if you don't like the way LaTeX
%				% breaks the chapter heading into lines, use
%\section{Another section}	% `\newheadline' command to break lines.
%				% Never use \\ in sectional (e.g., chapter,
%	... text ...		% section, subsection) headings.

%\chapter{Title of Second Chapter}	% Chapter 2.

% Alternatively, you may write the chapters in separate
