\section{Triggers}
The topology and basic kinematics of the \hzg process guide the choice of triggers used in this analysis. As this is a three body
decay, the \pT of the photon tends to be less than in other channels like \hgg. Consequently, the CMS photon trigger \pT thresholds 
are too great to make them viable options. Instead, we trigger on the leptons arising from the decay of the Z boson, which tend 
to have larger \pT. The best approach to maximize signal efficiency is to use the double lepton triggers. The double muon trigger 
has \pT thresholds of 17 and 8 GeV, and the double electron trigger has thresholds of 23 and 12 GeV. These are the lowest 
unprescaled double lepton triggers generally available for CMS Run 2 analysis. Events passing both the double muon and 
double electron triggers are treated as double muon events.

The triggers are applied to both data and simulation. Trigger efficiencies and scale factors are measured using the 
simulation samples corresponding to each data-taking year. These measurements use a tag and probe method [CITE]. The tag and probe  method
takes advantage of the high purity of $Z \rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell{-}$ events near the Z mass peak. One lepton functions as the 
tag, and satisfies a set of tight trigger, identification, isolation, \pT requirements. The second lepton, the probe, must pass a looser selection and is used to measure the efficiency in question. 
Using this approach, trigger efficiencies for each leg of a given 
double lepton trigger are measured in both data and simulation. Then a corrective scale factor, defined as the ratio of data efficiency 
to simulation efficiency, is applied to the simulation. Scale factors are measured and applied in bins of \pT and $|\eta|$.

For the double electron trigger efficiency measurements, the tag electron must satisfy the following requirements. It must pass 
the single electron trigger, pass a tight cut-based identification, have \pT $> 30 \, (35)$ in 2016 (2017/2018), and have $|\eta| < 2.5$. 
The probe electron must pass the loose electron MVA identification (with isolation) requirement. The efficiencies for each leg 
of the trigger are measured separately, so in each case, the probe electron must match the trigger leg being measured. The efficiencies 
and scale factors of each double electron trigger leg for 2016, 2017, and 2018 are shown in Figures [FIGS]. 

For the double muon trigger efficiency measurements, the tag muon must satisfy the following requirements. It must pass the single 
muon trigger, pass a tight cut-based identification, have \pT $> 26 \, (29)$ GeV for 2016 (2017/2018) and satisfy $|\eta| < 2.4$. The 
probe muon must pass the $H \rightarrow ZZ$ identification and isolation cuts. The details of the $H \rightarrow ZZ$ muon 
identification will be described later. The efficiencies for each leg of the trigger are measured separately, so in each case, the probe 
muon must match the trigger leg being measured. The efficiencies and scale factors of each double muon trigger leg for 2016, 2017, 
and 2018 are shown in Figures [FIGS].
