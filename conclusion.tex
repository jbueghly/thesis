\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
A search is performed for a standard model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into a lepton pair ($\Pe^{+}\Pe^{-}$ or $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$) and a photon with $m_{\ell^+\ell^-}>50$ \GeV. 
The analysis is performed using a sample of CMS proton-proton ($\Pp\Pp$) collision data at $\sqrt{s}=$13\TeV, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of \LumiT\fbinv. 
The main contribution to this final state is 
from Higgs boson decays to a $\PZ$ boson and a photon ($\PH\to\PZ\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$). 
The contributions from final-state radiation of $\PH\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ or $\PH\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$  
are at the $6$ and $<1$\% levels, respectively, and are not included in the measured $\PH\to\PZ\gamma$ signal.
The best fit value of the signal strength $\hat{\mu}$ for $m_\PH=\mH\GeV$ is $\hat{\mu}=\signalstrengthExpanded=\signalstrength$.  
This measurement corresponds to $\sigma(\Pp\Pp\to\PH)\mathcal{B}(\PH\to\PZ\gamma)=\,$\br\,pb. 
The measured value is \compatibility\, standard deviations higher than the SM prediction.
The observed (expected) local significance is \obssig\,(\expsig) standard deviations, where the expected significance is determined for the SM hypothesis.
The observed (expected) upper limit at $95$\% confidence level on $\mu$ is \obslimit\,(\explimit). 
In addition, a combined fit with the $\PH\to\PGg\PGg$ analysis of the same data set~\cite{CMS:2021kom} is performed to measure 
the ratio $\mathcal{B}(\PH\to\cPZ\gamma)/\mathcal{B}(\PH\to\gamma\gamma)=\brRatio$, which is consistent
with the ratio of $0.69 \pm 0.04$ predicted by SM at the \brRatioCompat\, standard deviation level for a Higgs boson mass of $\mH$\GeV.
